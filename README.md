# NYC311_Analysis

PROBLEM STATEMENT

NYC311 Executive Director, Joseph Morrisroe would like to understand how to improve time-to-close tickets in order to increase service request completion and provide top notch customer service. 

Conduct an analysis for 2018-2019 displaying how factors such as source of requests, agency type and location can have an affect on improving time-to-close tickets.


FINDINGS:

    ◉ Majority of requests were submitted by individuals contacting a customer representative over the phone.
    ◉ From 2018-2019, Noise and Unsanitary condition were the most common reasons for service requests.
    ◉ From 2018- 2019, NYPD was the primary agency with the largest number of requests collectively but were closed in less than 5 minutes due to lack of evidence.
    ◉ Average time to close service tickets took nearly 30 minutes to completed when incidents were located on the streets.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

    ◉ Actively market NYC311 online platform to ensure service requests are submitted in a timely manner
    ◉ Have buildings' property managers get involved in complaints within vicinity regarding noise
    ◉ Have police patrol around the neighborhoods where the majority of requests are centered (5th Avenue landmark) to ensure that request can be resolved more       effectively.
